# The app is hosted in the below:
I have implemented a clone of Netflix a web app which I built from scratch using ReactJS. I Have used The Movie Database (TMDB) API's to get the movies information. And hosted using Firebase a very nice and easy way to host your simple webapp (https://lnkd.in/gqUh6seR). Just for fun I have implemented this. 

The functionalities I have added: 
1. you can see only the movie trailer from youtube(by using react-youtube npm package I have achieved this)
2. You can see the list of movies and documentaries.
3. You can't watch entire movie ;)
